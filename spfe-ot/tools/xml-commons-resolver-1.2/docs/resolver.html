resources: documents rely on DTDs and schemas, schemas are derived from
other schemas, stylesheets are often customizations of other
stylesheets, documents refer to the schemas and stylesheets with which
the expect to be processed, etc.  These relationships are expressed
using URIs, most often URLs.</p><p>Relying on URLs to directly identify resources to be retrieved
often causes problems for end users:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>If they're absolute URLs, they only work when you can reach
them<sup>[<a href="#ftn.N10045" id="N10045">1</a>]</sup>. Relying on remote resources makes XML processing susceptible
to both planned and unplanned network downtime.
</p><p>The URL
“<span class="quote">http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.1.2/docbookx.dtd</span>”
isn't very useful if I'm on an airplane at 35,000 feet.</p></li><li><p>If they're relative URLs, they're only useful in the context where
the were initially created.
</p><p>The URL “<span class="quote">../../xml/dtd/docbookx.xml</span>” isn't useful
<span class="emphasis"><em>anywhere</em></span> on my system. Neither, for that matter,
is “<span class="quote">/export/home/fred/docbook412/docbookx.xml</span>”.</p></li></ol></div><p>One way to avoid these problems is to use an entity resolver
(a standard part of SAX) or a URI Resolver (a standard part of JAXP).
A resolver can examine the URIs of the resources being requested and
determine how best to satisfy those requests.</p><p>The best way to make this function in an interoperable way is to
define a standard format for mapping system identifiers and URIs.  The
<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/entity/" target="_top">OASIS Entity
Resolution Technical Committee</a> is defining an XML
representation for just such a mapping. These “<span class="quote">catalog files</span>”

local files (or just other URIs).</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="s.resolver.classes.12" />Resolver Classes Version 1.2</h3></div></div></div><p>The <a href="http://xml.apache.org/dist/xml/commons/" target="_top">Resolver classes</a> that are described

arise in several ways:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>I have an XML document that I want to publish on the web or
include in the distribution of some piece of software. On my system, I keep
the doctype of the document in some local directory, so my doctype declaration
reads:</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;!DOCTYPE article PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.1.2//EN"
                  "file:///n:/share/doctypes/docbook/xml/docbookx.dtd"&gt;</pre><p>As soon as I distribute this document, I immediately begin getting error
reports from customers who can't read the document because they don't have
DocBook installed at the location identified by the URI in my document.</p></li><li><p>Or I remember to change the URI before I publish the document:</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;!DOCTYPE article PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.1.2//EN"
                  "http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.1.2/docbookx.dtd"&gt;</pre><p>And the next time I try to edit the document, <span class="emphasis"><em>I get errors</em></span>
because I happen to be working on my laptop on a plane somewhere and can't
get to the net.</p></li><li><p>Just as often, I get tripped up this way: I'm working collaboratively
with a colleague. She's created initial drafts of some documents that I'm
supposed to review and edit. So I grab them and find that I can't open or
publish them because I don't have the same network connections she has or
I don't have my applications installed in the same place. And if I change the system
identifiers so they work on my system, she has the same problems when I send
them back to her.</p></li><li><p>These problems aren't limited to editing applications. If I write
a special stylesheet for formatting our collaborative document, it will
include some reference to the “<span class="quote">main</span>” stylesheet:</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;xsl:import href="/path/to/real/stylesheet.xsl"/&gt;
</pre><p>But this won't work on my colleague's machine because she has
the main stylesheet installed somewhere else.</p></li></ol></div><p>Public identifiers offer an effective solution to this problem,
at least for documents. They provide global, unique names for entities
independent of their storage location. Unfortunately, public
identifiers aren't used very often because many users find that they
cannot rely on applications resolving them in an interoperable
manner.</p><p>For XSLT, XML Schemas, and other applications that rely on URIs
without providing a mechanism for associating public identifiers with
them, the situation is a little more irksome, but it can still be
addressed using a URI Resolver.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="s.naming.resources" />Naming Resources</h2></div></div></div><p>In some contexts, it's more useful to refer to a resource by
name than by address.  If I want the version 3.1 of the DocBook DTD,
or the 1911 edition of Webster's dictionary, or <em class="citetitle">The
Declaration of Independence</em>, that's what I want,
irrespective of its location on the net (or even if it's available on
the net). While it is possible to view a URL as an address, I don't
think that's the natural interpretation.</p><p>There are currently two ways that I might reasonably assign an
address-independent name to an object: public identifiers or <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt" target="_top">Uniform Resource
Names</a> (URNs)<sup>[<a href="#ftn.N100D9" id="N100D9">2</a>]</sup>.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="s.public.ids" />Public Identifiers</h3></div></div></div><p>Public identifiers are part of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml" target="_top">XML
1.0</a>. They can occur in any form of external entity declaration. They
allow you to give a globally unique name to any entity. For example, the XML
version of DocBook V4.1.2 is identified with the following public identifier:</p><pre class="programlisting">-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.1.2//EN</pre><p>You'll see this identifier in the two doctype declarations I used earlier.
This identifier gives no indication of where the resource (the DTD) may be
found, but it does uniquely name the resource. That public identifier, now
and forever refers to the XML version of DocBook V4.1.2.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="s.urns" />Uniform Resource Names</h3></div></div></div><p>URNs are a form of URI. Like public identifiers, they give a location-neutral,
globally unique name to an entity. For example, OASIS might choose to identify
the XML version of DocBook V4.1.2 with the following URN:</p><pre class="programlisting">urn:oasis:names:specification:docbook:dtd:xml:4.1.2</pre><p>Like a public identifier, a URN can now and forever refer to a specific
entity in a location-independent manner.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="s.publicid" />The publicid URN Namespace</h4></div></div></div><p>Public identifiers don't fit very well into the web architecture
(they are not, for example, always valid URIs). This problem can be
addressed by the <code class="literal">publicid</code> URN namespace defined by
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3151.txt" target="_top">RFC 3151</a>.</p><p>This namespace allows public identifiers to be easily
represented as URNs. The OASIS XML Catalog specification accords
special status to URNs of this form so that catalog resolution occurs
in the expected way.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="s.resolving.names" />Resolving Names</h2></div></div></div><p>Having extolled the virtues of location-independent names, it must be
said that a name isn't very useful if you can't find the thing it refers to.
In order to do that, you must have a name resolution mechanism that allows
you to determine what resource is referred to by a given name.</p><p>One important feature of this mechanism is that it can allow resources
to be distributed, so you don't have to go to <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.1.2/docbookx.dtd" target="_top">http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.1.2/docbookx.dtd</a> to get the XML version of DocBook V4.1.2, if you have a local copy.</p><p>There are a few possible resolution mechanisms:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The application just “<span class="quote">knows</span>”. Sure, it sounds
a little silly, but this is currently the mechanism being used for namespaces.
Applications know what the semantics of namespaced elements are because they
recognize the namespace URI.</p></li><li><p>OASIS Catalog files provide a mechanism for mapping public
and system identifiers, allowing resolution to both local and distributed
resources. This is the resolution scheme we're going to consider for the balance
of this column.</p></li><li><p>Many other mechanisms are possible. There are already a few
for URNs, including at least one built on top of DNS, but they aren't widely
deployed.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="s.catalog.files" />Catalog Files</h2></div></div></div><p>Catalog files are straightforward text files that describe a mapping
from names to addresses. Here's a simple one:</p><div class="example"><a id="ex.catalog" /><p class="title"><b>Example 1. An Example Catalog File</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;catalog xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:entity:xmlns:xml:catalog"&gt;

&lt;public publicId="-//OASIS//DTD XML DocBook V4.1.2//EN"
        uri="docbook/xml/docbookx.dtd"/&gt;

&lt;system systemId="urn:x-oasis:docbook-xml-v4.1.2"
        uri="docbook/xml/docbookx.dtd"/&gt;

&lt;delegatePublic publicIdStartString="-//Example//"
          catalog="http://www.example.com/catalog"/&gt;
&lt;/catalog&gt;</pre></div></div><br class="example-break" /><p>This file maps both the public identifier and the URN I mentioned earlier
to a local copy of DocBook on my system. If the doctype declaration uses the
public identifier for DocBook, <span class="emphasis"><em>I'll get DocBook</em></span> regardless
of the (possibly bogus) system identifier! Likewise, my local copy of DocBook
will be used if the system identifier contains the DocBook URN.</p><p>The delegate entry instructs the resolver to use the catalog “<span class="quote"><code class="filename">http://www.example.com/catalog</code></span>”
for any public identifier that begins with “<span class="quote">-//Example//</span>”.
The advantage of delegate in this case is that I don't have to parse that
catalog file unless I encounter a public identifier that I reasonably expect
to find there.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="s.understanding" />Understanding Catalog Files</h2></div></div></div><p>The OASIS <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/entity/" target="_top">Entity Resolution

“<span class="quote">not an official committee work product and may not reflect the

<code class="sgmltag-element">catalog</code>. The official namespace name for OASIS XML
Catalogs is
“<span class="quote"><code class="literal">urn:oasis:names:tc:entity:xmlns:xml:catalog</code></span>”.</p><p>There are eight elements that can occur in an XML Catalog:

an XML Catalog.</p><p>The <code class="sgmltag-attribute">prefer</code> setting
determines whether or not public identifiers specified in the catalog
are to be used in favor of system identifiers supplied in the
document. Suppose you have an entity in your document for which both a
public identifier and a system identifier has been specified, and the
catalog only contains a mapping for the public identifier (e.g., a
matching <code class="sgmltag-element">public</code> catalog entry).  If the current
value of <code class="sgmltag-attribute">prefer</code> is
“<span class="quote">public</span>”, the URI supplied in the matching
<code class="sgmltag-element">public</code> catalog entry will be used. If it is
“<span class="quote">system</span>”, the system identifier in the document will be
used. (If the catalog contained a matching <code class="sgmltag-element">system</code>
catalog entry giving a mapping for the system identifier, that mapping
would have been used, the public identifier would never have been
considered, and the setting of override would have been
irrelevant.)</p><p>Generally, the purpose of catalogs is to
override the system identifiers in XML documents, so
<code class="sgmltag-attribute">prefer</code> should
usually be “<span class="quote">public</span>” in your catalogs.</p><p>The <code class="sgmltag-attribute">xml:base</code> URI is used to

document without any catalogs. For this example, I deleted the
<code class="literal">catalogs</code> entry on my

the parse fails:</p><div class="example"><a id="ex.nocat.sh" /><p class="title"><b>Example 7. Parsing Without a Catalog</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="screen">$ java org.apache.xml.resolver.apps.xparse -d 2 example.xml

   "file:///dev/this/does/not/exist/example.dtd".
Parse failed with 1 error and no warnings.</pre></div></div><br class="example-break" /><p>With an appropriate catalog file, we can map the public identifier
to a local copy of the DTD. We could have mapped the system identifier
instead (or as well), but the public identifier is probably more stable.
</p><p>Using a command-line option to specify the catalog, I can now
successfully parse the document:</p><div class="example"><a id="ex.withcat.sh" /><p class="title"><b>Example 8. Parsing With a Catalog</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="screen">$ java org.apache.xml.resolver.apps.xparse -d 2 -c catalog.xml example.xml

</pre></div></div><br class="example-break" /><p>The additional messages in each of these examples arise as a
consequence of the debugging option, <em class="replaceable"><code>-d 2</code></em>.
