        <title>Topic sets</title>
        <p>In SPFE, a <feature>documentation set</feature> consists of one of more <feature>topic sets</feature>. A topic set is a collection of topics, usually on a related subject. In a book-based environment, a topic set would be similar to a manual, in the sense that a paper-based documentation systems is made up of books or manuals. However, SPFE does not presume that a topic set constitutes a manual. It is simply a collection of related topics, and how the topics in the toic set are related to each other is up to the information architect.</p>
        <p>A topic set may be made up of individual topics written by authors. It may also be made up of topics <task>generated from external sources</task>, or of a <task>combination of written and generated sources</task>. In the case of topic sets created from external sources, you can also merge written content with the extracted content to form complete topics. This is a common approach to creating a reference document.</p>
        <p>A <task>topic set is defined</task> by a <feature>topic set configuration file</feature> using the configuration setting <config-setting>/spfe/topic-set</config-setting>. The topic set configuration specifies the topics t be included in the topic set. However, you should not think of this simply as a list of topics files to include. Instead, this of this as a query that returns a set of topics that meet a specific set of conditions. A topic may be added to a topic set simply by creating a topic that meets the conditions for inclusion in a particular topic set.</p>
        <p>Because a topic set is simply a configuration of topics, you can have more than one topic-set configuration that includes the same or a similar set of topics. You can do this as a means of <task>reusing topics</task>, or simply to create different build variations.</p>
