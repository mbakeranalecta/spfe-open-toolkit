        <title>Synthesis</title>
        <p><feature>Synthesis</feature> is the first step in the <feature>SPFE build</feature> process. The job of the synthesis step is to create a collection of fully resolved <feature>topic</feature> files as input to the <feature>presentation</feature> process. Fully resolved means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>All <feature>conditions</feature> have been applied.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>All <feature>strings</feature> and <feature>fragments</feature> have been resolved.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>All <feature>subject affinities</feature> have been fully resolved.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The synthesis process also includes the <task>extract and merge</task> operations, for those cases where content is being extracted from source files, and (where applicable) being merged with authored content to create complete topics.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the <feature>synthesis</feature> process generates <feature>link catalogs</feature> and <feature>toc files</feature> which are used by the <feature>presentation</feature> stage to <task>link and organize content</task>. </p>
