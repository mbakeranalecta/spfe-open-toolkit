        <title>Configuring SPFE Open Toolkit</title>

        <understanding>

            <p> The <feature> SPFE Open Toolkit </feature> (SPFE-OT) must be configured to control
                how it builds output from source XML markup. One or more configuration files
                specifies which source content will be processed, how it will be processed, and how
                it will be organized and linked. Together, the configuration files are the master
                plan for a SPFE build.  </p>

            <p> SPFE Open Toolkit configuration consists of the following major sections:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p> A <feature>content set</feature> configuration, which identifies topic sets
                        to be included in the build and how they should be organized.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> One or more <feature>topic set</feature> configurations, which identifies
                        source topics for the set and how they are to be processed.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> A <feature>topic-type</feature> configuration for each type of topic in the
                        content set. The topic-type configuration specifies an <feature>XML
                        Schema</feature> and the set of <feature>XSLT</feature> scripts that will be used to
                        build output.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> An <feature>output format</feature> configuration for each output media.</p>
                </li>

            </ul>

            <p> To create a body of content, an author will need to be concerned with the first two,
                content set and topic set configurations, which identify content source.
                Configuring topic types and output formats is not content specific and should be
                done beforehand by a SPFE Open Toolkit developer.</p>

        </understanding>

        <planning>

            <p> While configuration could be set in a single configuration file, in most cases it
                will be convenient to create one file to configure the <feature> content set
                </feature>, a separate file for each <feature> topic set </feature>, and a
                configuration file for each <feature> topic type </feature> and <feature> output
                    format </feature>. The first stage of the SPFE-OT build process will be to merge
                all into a single configuration that will be used for the build.</p>

            <p> The content set configuration file will be the entry point for the build process; it
                will be specified as the first argument of the <file-name>spfe</file-name> command
                that starts the build process. The content set configuration file will reference
                topic set configuration files and output-format configuration files, and topic set
                configuration files will, in turn, reference <feature>topic type</feature>
                configuration files along with source files and other resources.</p>

            <p> The content set and topic set configuration files may reside anywhere in the
                filesystem that is convenient for the author. References to configuration, source,
                and other files may be relative or absolute path names. A common setup has the
                content set configuration file in the working directory, where the <code>spfe</code>
                command will be executed and log files kept, with topic set configuration files and
                content files in subdirectories and referenced with relative paths. This way the
                entire set can be relocated without needing to edit configuration files.</p>

            <p> The SPFE build system will, by default, organize topics hierarchically with topic
                sets in separate groups and topics organized by topic type within a topic set. The
                build system will generate table of contents (TOC) with this organization to aid
                navigation. These TOCs are not the only navigation aids the build system generates;
                the system also creates subject-affinity links (<feature>soft links</feature>)
                and subject index lists. Nevertheless, hierarchical navigation is one way that
                content users will find what they want.</p>

            <p> Source content may be identified in topic set configuration files with wildcards
                in file pathnames. The asterisk "*" matches any set of characters except for the
                path-hierarchy separator, so that <code> &lt;include&gt;
                ../content/text/my-topic-set/*.xml &lt;/include&gt; </code> will include all the XML
                files in the "my-topic-set" directory. Thus, best practice is to keep topic source
                files in directories that correspond to topic sets.</p>

        </planning>

        <doing>

            <subhead>Author tasks</subhead>

            <p> Create a <feature>content set</feature> configuration XML file
                in the directory you will execute the <feature>spfe</feature> command to create
                builds or any convenient location. Use the <config-setting> /spfe/content-set
                </config-setting> XML structure. </p>

            <p> Create a <feature>topic set</feature> configuration XML file for each topic set
                using the <config-setting>/spfe/topic-set</config-setting> XML structure. </p>

            <subhead>Developer tasks</subhead>

            <p> Create a <feature>topic-type</feature> configuration XML file for each topic type
                using the <config-setting>/spfe/topic-type</config-setting> XML structure. </p>

            <p> Create a <feature>output-format</feature> configuration XML file for each output
                format using the <config-setting>/spfe/output-format</config-setting> XML structure.
            </p>
